# PWA Mobile Installation Fix

## Problem
The PWA was not installing correctly on mobile devices - it was only adding as a shortcut instead of a full installable app.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **SVG Icons Not Supported on Mobile**
- Many mobile browsers (especially iOS Safari) don't fully support SVG icons in PWA manifests
- Android also has limited SVG support for app icons

### 2. **Background Color Mismatch**
- Manifest had `background_color: "#ffffff"` (white) but app uses dark theme
- This caused a jarring flash when launching the app

### 3. **Theme Color Mismatch**
- Manifest had old theme color `#0d6efd` (Bootstrap blue) instead of `#1E4A73` (navy blue)

### 4. **Bootstrap Version Mismatch**
- Service worker was caching Bootstrap 5.3.3
- App was using Bootstrap 5.3.7
- This caused offline functionality to fail

### 5. **Hardcoded Fallback Manifest**
- `src/index.js` had an outdated hardcoded manifest that was being served instead of the real `manifest.json` file
- ASSETS binding was not being used properly

### 6. **Scope Trailing Slash**
- Manifest scope was `/stonks` instead of `/stonks/`
- This could cause navigation issues in standalone mode

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated `public/manifest.json`
```json
{
  "background_color": "#1E4A73",  // Changed from white to navy blue
  "theme_color": "#1E4A73",        // Changed from Bootstrap blue to navy
  "scope": "/stonks/",              // Added trailing slash
  "icons": [
    // Changed all icons from SVG to PNG for better mobile compatibility
    {
      "src": "/stonks/icons/icon-192x192.png",
      "type": "image/png",
      "purpose": "any"
    },
    {
      "src": "/stonks/icons/icon-192x192.png",
      "type": "image/png",
      "purpose": "maskable"
    }
    // ... (512x512 versions too)
  ]
}
```

### 2. Updated `src/utils.js`
```javascript
// Changed icon references from SVG to PNG
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="192x192" href="/stonks/icons/icon-192x192.png">
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="512x512" href="/stonks/icons/icon-512x512.png">
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="192x192" href="/stonks/icons/icon-192x192.png">
```

### 3. Updated `public/sw.js`
```javascript
// Updated Bootstrap version from 5.3.3 to 5.3.7
const urlsToCache = [
  'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.7/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css',
  'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.7/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js'
];

// Added skipWaiting() for immediate activation
self.skipWaiting();

// Added clients.claim() for immediate control
self.clients.claim();
```

### 4. Fixed `src/index.js`
```javascript
async function serveStaticFile(env, filename, contentType) {
  // Now properly tries ASSETS binding first
  if (env.ASSETS) {
    const response = await env.ASSETS.fetch(new Request(`https://placeholder/${filename}`));
    if (response.status === 200) {
      return response; // Serve actual file from assets
    }
  }
  
  // Fallback updated to match actual manifest.json
  const staticAssets = {
    'manifest.json': JSON.stringify({
      "background_color": "#1E4A73",
      "theme_color": "#1E4A73",
      "scope": "/stonks/",
      "icons": [
        // PNG icons instead of SVG
      ]
    })
  };
}
```

### 5. Updated `test/utils.test.js`
```javascript
// Updated tests to check for PNG icons instead of SVG
expect(html).toContain('href="/stonks/icons/icon-192x192.png"');
expect(html).toContain('href="/stonks/icons/icon-512x512.png"');
```

## Testing Instructions

### Desktop (Chrome/Edge)
1. Navigate to the app
2. Look for install icon in address bar
3. Click "Install" - should install as standalone app
4. Launch from desktop - should open in app window without browser UI

### Mobile (Android)
1. Open in Chrome
2. Tap menu (⋮) → "Add to Home screen" or "Install app"
3. Should show app icon and name (not "Add to Home screen")
4. Launch from home screen - should open in standalone mode
5. Check for splash screen with navy blue background

### Mobile (iOS)
1. Open in Safari
2. Tap Share button → "Add to Home Screen"
3. App should install with proper icon
4. Launch - should open in standalone mode
5. Status bar should be styled correctly

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] App installs as PWA (not just shortcut) on Android
- [ ] App installs properly on iOS via Safari
- [ ] Navy blue (#1E4A73) splash screen shows on launch
- [ ] No white flash when launching app
- [ ] App icons display correctly (192x192 and 512x512)
- [ ] Service worker registers successfully
- [ ] Offline mode works (cache Bootstrap CSS/JS)
- [ ] All 287 tests pass
- [ ] No console errors related to manifest or service worker

## Additional Notes

### Why PNG Instead of SVG?
- **iOS Safari**: Limited SVG support for app icons
- **Android**: Better compatibility with PNG
- **Maskable Icons**: Only PNG format ensures proper masking
- **File Size**: PNG icons are still small (~1-3KB)

### Why Navy Blue Background?
- Matches the app's primary color (#1E4A73)
- Eliminates white flash on app launch
- Creates professional, cohesive experience

### Service Worker Improvements
- `skipWaiting()`: Ensures new service worker activates immediately
- `clients.claim()`: Takes control of all pages immediately
- Better logging for debugging
- Correct Bootstrap version cached

## Production Deployment

Before deploying to production:
1. Run `npm run build` to update service worker cache version
2. Test on multiple devices (Android, iOS)
3. Verify ASSETS binding is configured in `wrangler.toml`
4. Check that PNG icons are uploaded to production
5. Test offline functionality
